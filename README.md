# Instantaneous Squid
> Add water, stir, and that's it!

Instantaneous Squid is a boringly simple Squid proxy server, without cache nor special functionalities meant to run as a proxy for incoming connections on 127.0.0.1.

## Motivation

Let's assume you've got a host in a different ISP (e.g. different country) and you want to SSH-tunnel into your private proxy in order to access it. This container provides a small and clean proxy for that purpose.
